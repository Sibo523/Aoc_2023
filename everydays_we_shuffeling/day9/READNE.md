tried to use מתמטיקה דיסקרטים at start, but turns out that the naive way is nice 
basically what I did is save each line seperate the numbers and then send to recursive function
keep going till I find all 0's then it goes back and add's the number from before the last number in the line
(when you add to the last value in line it will give you the next element in the sequence)
